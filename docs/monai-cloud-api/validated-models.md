# Supported Bundles

MONAI Bundles are a comprehensive set of pre-configured pipelines and models designed to accelerate the development and deployment of medical imaging applications. These bundles encapsulate best practices and cutting-edge techniques in medical imaging, providing a solid foundation for both research and clinical deployment. Each MONAI Bundle is tailored to specific imaging modalities, tasks, and workflows, enabling users to quickly adapt and extend them for a wide range of medical imaging scenarios. Whether you're building applications for image classification, segmentation, or registration, MONAI Bundles offer a flexible and efficient starting point.

The following table provides an essential overview of the support available for various models within the NGC MONAI Bundles. It outlines the compatibility of each bundle with real-time inference, batch training, and batch inference functionalities, offering insights into the operational scope and limitations of each. This resource is designed not only to assist users in selecting the most appropriate MONAI bundle for their medical imaging projects but also to serve as a foundational reference for those looking to implement their own custom bundles. By understanding the configurations and capabilities of existing bundles, users can better tailor their custom solutions to meet specific project requirements. Refer to the table below for a comprehensive view of the support status across different bundles.
