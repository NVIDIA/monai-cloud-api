# Jupyter Notebooks

The best way to get started with MONAI Cloud APIs is through our Jupyter Notebooks. These notebooks contain code snippets that walk you through various workflows, demonstrating how to effectively use the MONAI Cloud APIs. You can access these materials on the [NVIDIA MONAI Cloud API GitHub](https://github.com/NVIDIA/monai-cloud-api/).

## Introduction Notebooks

These notebooks are designed to introduce you to the MONAI Cloud APIs, helping you get started, manage credentials, and understand how to create datasets and select models.

- **Getting Started**
