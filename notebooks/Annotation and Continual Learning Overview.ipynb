    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Annotation and Continual Learning are core features of NVIDIA MONAI Cloud APIs, streamlining the process of refining datasets and enhancing model performance progressively. Continual learning leverages accumulated annotations to improve the model iteratively. This guide will assist you in setting up and optimizing these critical tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into annotation and continual learning, we're going to quickly create our dataset and experiment that will be used for the annotation workflow.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Can Expect to Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to demonstrate how you can utilize the APIs to ensure your models adapt and improve over time with new data inputs. We will show you how to configure your datasets, manage annotation tasks, and effectively employ continual learning strategies to maximize the accuracy and efficiency of your models. By the end of this notebook, you will have a solid understanding of the annotation process and continual learning mechanisms within the MONAI Cloud API platform, empowering you to initiate these practices in your own projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We're going to use the `realtime_infer` parameter when creating our experiment as that will automatically load the experiment and make sure it's ready for our annotation and continual learning workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've covered these steps in-depth in our other notebooks, you can find them below. If you haven't already gone through those notebooks, we encourage you to go back and review those first.\n",
