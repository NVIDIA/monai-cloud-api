    "In this guide, we will walk you through setting up a real-time inference system using a custom MONAI bundle with MONAI Cloud APIs. We will cover experiment setup, making predictions on-the-fly, and managing outputs to ensure a seamless, efficient, and real-time decision-making pipeline.\n",

    "\n",
    "Transitioning to real-time inference can substantially elevate the responsiveness and applicability of AI models in healthcare. Analyzing and interpreting medical images as they are generated, and instantly providing insights, can be transformative, offering benefits such as improved patient outcomes and more efficient use of medical resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You Can Expect to Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this guide is to demonstrate how you can start a live session to perform real-time inference with your custom MONAI bundle. You will either need to prepare your own MONAI bundle or use the existing bundle in MONAI Model Zoo. We will walk you through the process of setting up the environment, creating a dataset, configuring the experiment, and performing real-time inference. The result of the real-time inference will be multi-part files which contains the outcomes of the inference (e.g. segmentation masks, classification results in CSV format, and etc.)."

    "## Dataset Creation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Remote Storage Object as Data Sources**\n",
    "\n",
    "MONAI Cloud platform supports a range of other cloud storage solutions, including Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage (GCP) and Amazon S3, providing you with the flexibility to choose the service that best fits your project's needs. Below is an example of Azure:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. Creating a Storage Account and Container\n",
    "   - **Storage Account**: Start by creating a new storage account in your Azure portal. This account will host your blob storage containers.\n",
    "   - **Container Creation**: Within your storage account, create a new container. This container will hold your datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Container URL\n",
    "   - Once the container is created, you will be provided with a unique URL that can be used to access it. This URL will be essential for accessing your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Obtaining Credentials**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Access Keys**: Access your storage account and navigate to the 'Access keys' section. Here, you will find the necessary credentials to access your Blob Storage programmatically.\n",
    "- **Shared Access Signature (SAS)**: Alternatively, you can create a SAS for more granular control over permissions and access duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Creating a Manifest JSON File**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the root of your Azure container, create a manifest JSON file to keep track of your datasets. The file format is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a segmentation task:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"root_path\": \"https://[your-storage-account-name].blob.core.windows.net/[your-container-name]/[subfolder-path]\",\n",
