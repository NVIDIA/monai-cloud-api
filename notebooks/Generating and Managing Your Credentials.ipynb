    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a secure experience and maintain data privacy, NVIDIA MONAI Cloud APIs require authentication. This tutorial will guide you through the process of generating and managing these API credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating Your API Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accessing the Credentials Dashboard**:\n",
    "    - Navigate to NVIDIA NGC.\n",
    "    - Login\n",
    "    - Click on your User dropdown in the top-right\n",
    "    - Click on 'Setup'\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Requesting New Credentials**:\n",
    "    - Click on 'Get API Key'\n",
    "    - Click on the 'Generate New Key'\n",
    "    - After confirmation, you'll receive your API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Storing Your Credentials**:\n",
    "    - It's crucial to store this API key securely. \n",
    "    - We recommend copying the key and storing it in a secure password manager or an encrypted file.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Additional resources for configuration:\n",
    "- https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/gpu-cloud/ngc-user-guide/index.html\n",
    "- https://ngc.nvidia.com/setup\n",

    "    \n",
    "## Testing Your API Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a seamless experience with NVIDIA MONAI Cloud APIs, it's crucial to validate that your credentials are correctly set up. Let's test them.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Replace Placeholders**: In the code block below, replace the placeholders (`<MONAI Cloud API address>`, and `<Your NGC API Key>`) with your actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Run the Code Block**: Execute the code. If everything is set up correctly, it will print a success statement. If there's an issue, it will guide you toward troubleshooting.\n"

    "## Refreshing Your Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, you might need to refresh or renew your API credentials. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the same 'Credentials' section on the dashboard.\n",
    "2. Click the `Generate` a new key button.\n",
    "3. Confirm any prompts. A new key will replace the old one, rendering the old key inactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you refresh your credentials, any application using the old key will no longer work and will need to be updated with the new key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Securing Your Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avoid Hardcoding in Scripts**: Never hardcode your API keys directly in your scripts or applications.\n",
    "2. **Use Environment Variables**: A safer approach is to store your API key as an environment variable and then access it in your script.\n",
    "3. **Limited Sharing**: Only share your credentials with trusted individuals or teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example to fetch the API key from environment variables\n",
    "API_KEY = os.environ.get('MONAI_API_KEY')\n",
    "\n",
    "if API_KEY is None:\n",
    "    print(\"API_KEY is not set. Ensure the MONAI_API_KEY environment variable is correctly configured.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Key Expiry**: If you're facing authentication issues, check the validity of your API key. It might have expired.\n",
    "2. **Invalid Key Format**: Ensure that the key hasn't been truncated or modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "You're now equipped with the knowledge to generate, manage, and secure your credentials for the NVIDIA MONAI Cloud APIs. As a next step, you can dive into setting up your dataset, initializing models, or any other task you wish to pursue with the APIs."
