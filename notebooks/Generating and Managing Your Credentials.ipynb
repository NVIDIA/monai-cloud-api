    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDIA MONAI Cloud APIs require authentication to ensure a secure experience and maintain data privacy. This tutorial covers generating and managing these credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generating Your API Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Accessing the Credentials Dashboard**:\n",
    "    - Navigate to NVIDIA NGC\n",
    "    - Log in\n",
    "    - Click on your user dropdown at the top-right, and select 'Setup'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Requesting New Credentials**:\n",
    "    - Click 'Get API Key'\n",
    "    - Click 'Generate New Key'\n",
    "    - Upon confirmation, you will receive your API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Storing Your Credentials**:\n",
    "    - Store this API key securely, preferably in a password manager or an encrypted file.\n",
    "    - Envrionment variables are a common way to store API keys. For example, you can add the following line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file:\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    export MONAI_API_KEY=<Your NGC API Key>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "Additional resources for configuration:\n",
    "- https://docs.nvidia.com/ngc/gpu-cloud/ngc-user-guide/index.html\n",
    "- https://ngc.nvidia.com/setup\n",
    "- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBNt4qSnn0k\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Testing Your API Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure a seamless experience with NVIDIA MONAI Cloud APIs, it is crucial to validate that your credentials are correctly set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Run the Code Block**: \n",
    "Execute the code. If everything is set up correctly, it will print a success statement. If there's an issue, it will guide you toward troubleshooting.\n"

    "## Refreshing Your Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, you might need to refresh or renew your API credentials. Here's how:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the same 'Credentials' section on the dashboard\n",
    "2. Click the `Generate New Key`\n",
    "3. Confirm any prompts. A new key will replace the old one, rendering the old key inactive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you refresh your credentials, any application using the old key will no longer work and will need to be updated with the new key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Securing Your Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Avoid hard coding in scripts**: Never hardcode your API keys directly in your scripts or applications.\n",
    "2. **Use environment variables**: A safer approach is to store your API key as an environment variable and then access it in your script.\n",
    "3. **Limit sharing**: Only share your credentials with trusted individuals or teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example to fetch the API key from environment variables\n",
    "API_KEY = os.environ.get('MONAI_API_KEY')\n",
    "\n",
    "if API_KEY is None:\n",
    "    print(\"API_KEY is not set. Ensure the MONAI_API_KEY environment variable is correctly configured.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Key expiration**: If you're facing authentication issues, check the validity of your API key. It might have expired.\n",
    "2. **Invalid key format**: Ensure the key is complete and has not been truncated or modified.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "You're now equipped with the knowledge to generate, manage, and secure your credentials for the NVIDIA MONAI Cloud APIs. As a next step, you can dive into setting up your dataset, initializing models, or any other task you wish to pursue with the APIs."
